## Installation

Please choose your preferred installation method. They all ultimately install the kodit
cli, which contains the kodit MCP server and other tools to manage your data sources.

### Docker

```sh
docker run -it --rm registry.helix.ml/helix/kodit:latest
```

Always replace latest with a specific version.

### pipx

```sh
pipx install kodit
```

### homebrew

```sh
brew install helixml/kodit/kodit
```

### uv

```sh
uv tool install kodit
```

### pip

Use this if you want to use kodit as a python library:

```sh
pip install kodit
```

## Usage

Kodit has two key parts. A configuration CLI to manage what gets indexed and an MCP
server to expose your code to an AI coding assistant.

1. Add a source: `kodit sources create /path/to/your/code`
2. Create an index on that source: `kodit indexes create 1`
3. Test retrieval on your index: `kodit retrieve "test"`
4. Start an MCP server: `kodit serve`

Now browse to your AI coding assistant and add the MCP server. You will also need to
tell your assistant to use this server in coding tasks, otherwise it won't get called!

### Integration with Cursor

Add the following to `.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "code-search": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8080/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

Now add the following prompt to `.cursor/rules/kodit.mdc` in your project directory:

```markdown
---
description: 
globs: 
alwaysApply: true
---
You MUST use the code-search MCP tool and always include any file context the user has provided in the chat.```

Alternatively, you can browse to the cursor settings and set this prompt globally.
